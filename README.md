Space Invaders – Classic Arcade Shooter (Python + Pygame)

This is a recreated version of the classic Space Invaders arcade game built using Python and Pygame. The player controls a blue pentagon-shaped spaceship that can move horizontally and shoot bullets to destroy incoming enemies.

The goal is to shoot down as many enemies as possible while preventing them from reaching the bottom of the screen. Each enemy destroyed increases your score, and the game ends when any enemy gets too close.

🎮 Features

Smooth player movement with keyboard controls (←, →, Space to shoot).

Multiple enemies that move and descend dynamically.

Collision detection between bullets and enemies.

Real-time scoring system.

“Game Over” screen when enemies breach your defense line.
